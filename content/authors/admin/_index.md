I’m a MSc student at the LAMSADE group at Université Paris Dauphine. I'm looking into the applications of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search, generalizing AlphaZero to multiplayer games (Multiplayer Go), following up on my previous Master’s work about AlphaZero adaptation to Stochastic Environments (Settlers of Catan)
