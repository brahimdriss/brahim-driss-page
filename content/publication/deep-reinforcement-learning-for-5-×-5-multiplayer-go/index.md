  In recent years, much progress has been made in computer

  Go and most of the results have been obtained thanks to search algorithms (Monte Carlo Tree Search) and Deep Reinforcement Learning

  (DRL). In this paper, we propose to use and analyze the latest algorithms that use search and DRL (AlphaZero and Descent algorithms) to

  automatically learn to play an extended version of the game of Go with

  more than two players. We show that using search and DRL we were

  able to improve the level of play, even though there are more than two

  players.

summary: In this work, we analyzed the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning in the
  Multiplayer Go variant of the game of Go, using AlphaZero and Descent
  algorithms, showing their applicability and success in this more complex
  context.
