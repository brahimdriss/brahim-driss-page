abstract: "Catan is a popular multiplayer board game that involves multiple
  gameplay notions: stochastic elements related to the dice rolls as well as to
  the initial placement of resources on the map and the drawing of development
  cards, strategic notions for the placement of the cities and the roads which
  call upon topological and shape recognition notions and notions of expectation
  of gains linked to the probabilities of the rolls of the dice. In this paper,
  we develop a policy for this game using a convolutional neural network. The
  used deep reinforcement learning algorithm is Expert Iteration [2] which has
  already given excellent results for Alpha Zero and its descendants."
